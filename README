fractal-scripts
An effort at drawing various types of fractals.

Until now the focus has been the Mandelbrot set
and Julia sets of the map z -> z ^ 2 + C for various
complex constants C.

Algorithms take advantage of a theorem, which states 
that if |z| > max(|C|, 2), then iterations of map
z -> z ^ 2 + C will diverge towards infinity.
